HelloworldExample_Name= A Helloworld Agent in SARL
HelloworldExample_Description= A simple agent displaying Hello on the console and dying 2sec later.

BehaviorsExample_Name= Agent with a behavior
BehaviorsExample_Description= A simple agent playing an externally described behavior to compute a factorial.

BehaviorsInheritanceExample_Name= Agent with a behavior extending an existing behavior
BehaviorsInheritanceExample_Description= A simple example to illustrate the richness of behavior inheritance and corresponding overload in SARL.

CountdownExample_Name= A simple Agent decrementing an integer before dying
CountdownExample_Description= A first illustration of the concept of task to schedule a sub process doing something from a given behavior.

HolarchyExample_Name= A first example of holarchy
HolarchyExample_Description= Creation of complete hierarchy of holons.

CounterExample_Name= Two simple agents in basic interaction
CounterExample_Description= A first agent creates two other agents, the first one counting to 3 before dying and sending message to the second.

FactorialExample_Name= Two examples of factorial computation
FactorialExample_Description= The first demo introduces a single agent computing a factorial, the second one introduces two agents in interaction: the first agent asking the second to compute the factorial value of a specified integer.

io_sarl_tutorials_holonicauction_Name = Auction between holonic members
io_sarl_tutorials_holonicauction_Description = The auctioneer creates biders in its inner context, and manages the auction.

io_sarl_tutorials_pingpong_Name = Ping-Pong event exchanges
io_sarl_tutorials_pingpong_Description = Agents are exchanging events with a ping-pong interaction protocol.

io_sarl_tutorials_pingpongspace_Name = Ping-Pong event exchanges inside a specific space 
io_sarl_tutorials_pingpongspace_Description = Agents are exchanging events inside a specific space with a ping-pong interaction protocol.

io_sarl_demos_fireworks_Name = Fireworks with JavaFX
io_sarl_demos_fireworks_Description = The goal of this demo is to bring out some fireworks using SARL agents. The application is composed of 4 types of agents. The whole structure is holonic.

io_sarl_demos_sierpinskifractals_Name = Fractals of Sierpinski
io_sarl_demos_sierpinskifractals_Description = Sierpinski's fractals is built with triangles which are recursively divided into 3 triangles. In this application each triangle is supported by an agent in a hierarchy of agents.
