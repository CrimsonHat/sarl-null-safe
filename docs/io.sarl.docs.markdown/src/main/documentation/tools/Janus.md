# Janus Command-line Launcher

[:Outline:]

[:Fact:]{(io.sarl.sre.boot.Boot)::getDefaultSreProgramName == '[:name](janus)'}

[Janus](http://www.janusproject.io) is the default SARL Run-time Environment (SRE).
Its role is to provide all the libraries and plugins that are needed for running SARL agents.

For launching the Janus platform from a command-line shell, you could use the [:name:] tool.

## Usage

The [:name:] tool takes arguments:


	[:name!] [OPTIONS] <[:agname](agent_fully_qualified_name)>


The [:agname:] is the name of the agent to launch. This name is equal to the
fully qualified name of the agent's type.

<note>Janus enables to launch only one agent from the command-line shell. If you want to launch
more than one agent, you should launch a first agent, which will create the other agents.</note>

You could change the behavior of the [:name:] tool with the command-line options.
For obtaining a list of the options, type:

	[:name!] -help


## Command-Line Options

The Janus framework provides options on the command-line.
The list of the options is displayed below. This list includes
all the standard modules of Janus. If you add an extra module into
the classpath of your application, more options may become available.



| Option | Description |
